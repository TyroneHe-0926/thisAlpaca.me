        <h5 class="p-content">I was born and raised in Shanghai (amazing city that you
            should probably visit if
            you haven't yet). My family and I immigrated to Vancouver while I was in grade 6.
            <br>
            <br> I am currently an software
            engineering undergraduate student at University of Waterloo.
            <br>
            <br> Besides school and work, I probably spend 50% of my leisure time gaming. I have wasted around 2000hrs
            in
            DOTA2,
            written some small mods for Terraria. I am on Cyberpunk and Chinese RPG games recently. I'll have my
            stream
            id in contacts, feel free to add me.

            <br> Basketball is probably the only sport I kinda play. This was my "personal" court (just an elementary
            school basketball court besides my house). Good memories. Still hit it up everytime when I go home during
            the breaks.

            Right now I am also working on my broken Japanese. I have been to Japan for a couple of times, definitely my
            favorite country.
            <br>
            <br> I used to think I could just speak Japanese since I watched a lot of anime. Well, it was true to come
            extent, I really could speak ANIME Japanese, untill I figured out nobody speaks like that.
            <br>
            <br> So yeah, I got myself some books, and learning actual Japanese is just something I m trying to practice
            a little everyday.
